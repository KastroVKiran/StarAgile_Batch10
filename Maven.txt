MAVEN
-------------------------
==> Introduction to Build Tools
Maven is a build tool that is used to create the initial project folder structure to develop the source code of the application.
Based on the programming language, we have different build tools;
	Java			-----> Maven
	Python		-----> PyBuilder
	Ruby		-----> Rakes
	.NET		-----> MS Build

Other build tools;
ant, gradle...

Project (Netflix)	-----> Developers will write the source code of the application

Maven is used for the projects which are developed by using Java Programming Language (JPL)
Maven is also known as Java Build Tool
Maven is an opensource and free tool

==> Features of Maven
1. Using Maven we can create the initial project folder structure

2. Using Maven we can download the dependencies that are required to develop the application

What is a dependency?
Chicken Biryani ----> Chicken (Main ingredient); Rice, Masala items..... (Additional ingredients)
Netflix	-----> Java; Frameworks (Dependencies)

How maven will download the dependencies?
When we create a project folder structure using maven, we will get 2 things inside that folder structure.
	1. "src" folder		----> contains source code of the application
	2. "pom.xml" file	----> is the place we configure the dependencies required to develop the application

POM - Project Object Model
XML - Extension Markup Language

3. Using Maven we can compile the source code of the application
All java files will have an extension as <FileName>.java
.java files consists of source code of the application. This code is in human readable format
Machines cannot understand our language - machines can only understand binary language (0s and 1s)
We need to convert the human understandable language to machine understandable language
The process of converting the human understandable language into machine understandable language is known as COMPILATION
Using maven we can do the compilation
Once the code is compiled, we can deploy that code

				compile							execute
	.java file ----------------------------------> .class file -------------------------------------> JVM ----------------------------> Output


4. When we have multiple .java files, using maven we can package all the .java files. Once after packaging, we can compile them directly - PACKAGING
In realtime, using java we can develop two major types of applications;
	1. Standalone Applications	-----> .jar file	(Java Archive)
	2. Web Applications		-----> .war file	(Web Archive)
	3. Enterprise Applications	-----> .ear file	(Enterprise Archive)

These packaging types are called as ARTIFACTS
Artifacts can be stored in an artifact repo tools such as Nexus, JFrog.
In AWS we can store in S3 bucket

==> Introduction to Maven
Maven is developed by using Java Programming Language
Maven is also known as Java Build Tool
If you want to work with Maven, we need to install JAVA in our machines
Maven is developed by Apache organization

yum install maven -y (Linux)
apt install maven -y (Ubuntu)
The above commands will automatically install java in the machine

==> Download and install Java and Maven
https://www.oracle.com/in/java/technologies/downloads/#jdk21-windows

Configuration of Java
JAVA_HOME
JAVA PATH

Configuration of Maven
MAVEN_HOME
MAVEN PATH

==> Creation of Standalone Application
mvn archetype:generate -DgroupId=com.example.app -DartifactId=my-standalone-app -DarchetypeArtifactId=maven-archetype-quickstart -DinteractiveMode=false

==> Creation of Web Application
mvn archetype:generate -DgroupId=com.example.web -DartifactId=my-web-app -DarchetypeArtifactId=maven-archetype-webapp -DinteractiveMode=false

==> How to configure dependencies in the pom.xml file?
www.mvnrepository.com -----> where you can find depedencies

==> How maven will download these dependencies?
Types of maven repositories;
	1. Local repo		---- will be available in the local laptop
	2. Central repo	---- mvnrepository.com
	3. Remote repo	---- Nexus/JFrog

==> Maven Goals
All maven goals will start with "mvn"
1. Clean - mvn clean*
It will delete the existing target folder and its contents

2. Compile - mvn compile*
It will compile the source code of the application (.java ----> .class)
It will create the TARGET folder inside which .class files will be available

3. Test - mvn test
It will perform the unit test execution of the source code

4. Package - mvn package*
This goal will generate the artifact, inside a "TARGET" folder

5. Install - mvn install
To install the project as a dependency  in the local repo

Note: Whenever developer updates the code, as a DevOps engineer, we need to generate a new artifact. This artifact has to be deployed into the servers.

Note: All maven goals should be execute from the path where "pom.xml" file is available
